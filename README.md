CSS3-Tooltips
=============

Pure CSS3 tooltips.

General problems
The tooltip position is relative to the link, not the cursor
Some CSS properties, such as display:none, cause problems with the transition
It's not possible to place the tooltip above the link in a dynamic way

Webkit (Chrome & Safari)
Underline inheritance can't be reset
Firefox
Transitions work since version 4

Opera
No problems

Internet Explorer
Everything works correctly from version 9
